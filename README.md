## Question 14:  
What is the most accurate overview of flows of refugees between countries that can be obtained? Are there typical characteristics of refugee origin and destination countries? Are there typical characteristics of large flows of refugees? Can countries that will produce large numbers of refugees be predicted? Can refugee flows be predicted?

## Main Questions that we want to answer
- Are there typical characteristics of refugee origin and destination countries?
    - We understand that this question tries to specify why people go from a to b
    - Refugees are not refugees because of economic reasons alone, must be something else (that is what Hanbury said)
- Can countries that will produce large numbers of refugees be predicted?
    - We understand that this question tries to identify features which are important for migration
